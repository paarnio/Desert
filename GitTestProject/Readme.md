Problem with History view

After updating to Eclipse 4.5 Mars the History view always remains blank, no matter if I drag a file from the Eclipse Navigator or select Team >> Show History from the context menu.



Using Package Explorer, select file and VIA SpeedBar (rh-mouse-button-select) use Team > Show History.
